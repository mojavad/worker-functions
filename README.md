# Worker Functions
Full-stack Typesafety with Cloudflare Workers 👷

An opinionated SDK to get up and running with Cloudflare Workers: 

- **Fully Typesafe**, with frontend client inheriting arguments/return types directly from function definitions. 🦺
- Just write **Simple Functions**, without requiring any manual calling and configuring of `fetch` requests. 🏃
- Virtually **no boilerplate** - simply instantiate a client and get started. 🚀
